        <p>Dylan arrived on time and presented well for his induction appointment. He filled in all the paperwork required without any resistance and said he understood the process. He mentioned his mum had talked to him a lot over the weekend and helped him to calm down. His mum appears to be a positive influence in his life, which I would like to explore further with him.

        </p>
        <p>I talked to Dylan about the next steps and he seemed surprised about wanting to work together on his sentence plan. I gave him an appointment for two weeks time, which he put in his phone and showed me. I told him he would get a reminder of the appointment but reiterated how important it was for him to turn up.
